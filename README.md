## ABOUT ME 👋

**kyleegit27/kyleegit27** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on psychology research and how to reduce carbon footprint.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about VS code and puppy training.
- 💬 Ask me about running, nutrition, and UVA.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm running the NYC Marathon this year.
